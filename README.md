# hello-world
The hello-world guide repository

I'm finally starting to use GitHub for version control and version history keeping. I sure hope it'll make my code changes more understandable. In order to use GitHub I started the hello-world guide and well this is why I'm writing this edit. 

So far I'm mainly doing coding in the Arduino IDE but I plan on switching to Visual Studio Code and learning some Java. After all I want to improve myself instead of staying where I am, I need to have a challenge.
